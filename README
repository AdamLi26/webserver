Instruction for running the program:
-> put your website files in the "website" directory 
-> go to "src" directory
-> make 
-> ./webserver + (port_number)
.....: At this point, the webserver is on. 
	   You can open the browser to connect to the server.
       For exmpale, type "localhost:(port_number)/index.html"
-> (ctrl + C) to stop the webserver program
-> make clean

Few notes:
- only support HTTP/1.1, that is, if in the request message header field, version has to be specified as "http/1.1"
- support content type: text/html img/gif img/jpeg img/x-icon
- support decoding url (only can decode space for now)
- the client does not specify any path, e.g: localhost:(port_numer),
it has the same effect as: localhost:(port_numer)/index.html
